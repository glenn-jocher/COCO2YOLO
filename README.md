# 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the [COCO2YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/COCO2YOLO) repository! Our tool is designed to seamlessly convert datasets in JSON format to the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) format used for object detection tasks. This utility is compatible with Linux, MacOS, and Windows environments.

# 📋 Requirements

To use this conversion tool, you need Python 3.8 or a newer version. Make sure all dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/JSON2YOLO/blob/master/requirements.txt) are installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 📚 Quick Documentation

## How to Use

After installing dependencies, you can start converting your JSON datasets with the following steps:

1. Place your JSON dataset in the specified input directory.
2. Run the provided script (detailed instructions in the usage section).
3. Retrieve your YOLO-formatted data from the output directory.

The script handles the CSV generation process, ensuring that your data aligns perfectly with the YOLO training formats. Comments will be added to code blocks in the script to clarify any steps taken during conversion.
